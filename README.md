# Hi, I’m Rohit 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** who enjoys building systems that actually run in production — at scale, under constraints, with real users and real consequences.

Currently working on **quantitative risk platforms** at **Morgan Stanley**, after shipping large-scale fulfillment, robotics, and mobile systems at **Walmart Global Tech**.

I like problems that sit at the intersection of **backend systems**, **distributed workflows**, and **practical AI**.

---

## What I work on

- **Backend & Distributed Systems**
  - Spring Boot microservices, Kafka-based pipelines, async workflows
  - Databases, state machines, schedulers, orchestration layers
  - Designed systems serving **5000+ locations** and **100M+ sessions/year**

- **Frontend (when it matters)**
  - React / React Native for production dashboards and mobile apps
  - Strong believer that frontend systems deserve real architecture too

- **AI (used carefully)**
  - RAG systems, LLM agents, document intelligence
  - Interested in *useful* GenAI — not demos, not hype

## Career snapshot

- **Software Engineer III — Morgan Stanley**  
  _Quantitative Risk Platform_  
  Designing backend systems and data pipelines for enterprise-grade risk analytics.

- **Software Engineer II — Walmart Global Tech**  
  _Fulfillment & Automation_  
  Built and owned systems powering robotics workflows, inventory corrections, and mobile apps across thousands of stores.  
  Recipient of **3× Bravo Awards** for architecture and impact.

## Things I care about

- Writing code that other engineers can live with
- Clear ownership over shiny abstractions
- Systems that survive bad data, bad days, and bad assumptions
- Learning deeply instead of chasing trends

---

## Tech I’m comfortable with

**Languages**  
Java, Python, JavaScript / TypeScript, Kotlin, Go

**Backend**  
Spring Boot, Kafka, REST APIs, distributed systems, cron & schedulers

**Frontend**  
React, React Native, Redux, TypeScript

**Data & Infra**  
PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / Azure

**AI**  
RAG, LlamaIndex, LangChain, LLM agents, prompt engineering

## A few personal projects

- **GenAI Log & Audit Assistant**  
  RAG-powered system to query large log stores (Splunk/OpenObserve).  
  Reduced incident resolution time significantly for internal teams.

- **Text → 3D Asset Generator**  
  End-to-end pipeline converting natural language prompts into production-ready 3D models.

- **Mobile Recipe Assistant**  
  React Native app using image classification + preferences to suggest recipes.

## Outside of code

I enjoy learning things *slowly and properly* — whether that’s system design, investing basics, psychology, or building side projects that may or may not ever ship.
